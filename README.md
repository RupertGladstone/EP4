# Elmer/Ice Paraview Python Post-Processing utilities (EP4)

These functions were based on scripts generated within Paraview.  The general aim is to quickly produce a set of standard output plots without having to go through the Paraview interface.  Can be helpful if running on a remote HPC machine where connectivity may be a limiting factor.  Simply run the scripts then download a few plots instead of downloading the full set of .pvtu files.  

In some way these scripts can be see as an alternative to saving Paraview states.  In fact, it should be possible to run these within Paraview to provide a starting point for further editing.  Advantages compared to states include: plot files are generated by the scripts but can't be from states, and opening the Paraview GUI is not required.

A benefit of fully scripting plotting is reproducibility.  If using plots in presentations or publications the script can be re-run following modifications to quickl reproduce the required plots.

To use these functions you need paraview python installed.

## To use these functions for a different region:

The default parameters are for PIG.

The camera properties and and x and y resolutions govern the region to be plotted.  In particular: 

The default view is looking down in which case 'cameraHeight' governs the zoom.

'camerax' and 'cameray' give the centre position for the plots.

'xres' and 'yres' determine the resoslution in the x and y directions.  Their ratio determines the width to height ratio of the resulting plot.


Some of the variable names are hard coded (e.g. velocity and groundedmask for the velocity and GL contours).

## To run:

cp EP4_defaultPlots.py EP4_myPlots.py

Edit the parameters in EP4_myPlots.py according to needs then run:

pvpython EP4_myPlots.py
